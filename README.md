# sumobot-arduino-robotics
Autonomous sumobot built with Arduino for inter-university robotics competition (YorkU, UofT, McMaster)
# 🤖 Sumobot | YorkU Robotics Society

This project features a fully autonomous sumobot designed for inter-university competition between York University, University of Toronto, and McMaster University. Built using an Arduino Nano, IR sensors for arena edge detection, and an ultrasonic sensor for opponent tracking, the robot is coded in C++ using the Arduino IDE. The chassis was designed in CAD and 3D printed. Developed and competed as part of YorkU Robotics Society.
